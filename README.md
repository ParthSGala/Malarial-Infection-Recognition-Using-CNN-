# Malarial-Infection-Recognition-Using-CNN

Malaria is a serious, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal, disease spread by mosquitoes and caused by a parasite. Malaria was a significant health risk in the U.S. until it was eliminated by multiple disease-control programs in the late 1940s. The illness presents with flu-like symptoms that include high fever and chills.

Therefore in this project I have tried creating Convolution Neural Network Model using keras library for classifying images of Normal and Malaria parasite infected human blood sample.
